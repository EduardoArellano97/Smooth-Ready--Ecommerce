This project is created to show two different points of view: User and Admin. 

Users need to see what the store is offering, so the products need to be registered in the database and be shown in the index page.
As the admin, you are able to register new products. To do so, you need to visit the /admin url. As follows:

You will have access to a dropdown list which has 4 options. Clicking on "Products" will let you create new products and add images to it, so the user
will be delighted with the products you add.

Naturally, admin will have access to the products CRUD.

As a user, you may want to buy some of the web page products so you add them to the cart. To proceed you need to identify yourself first with the login form.

If you don't have an account just click on "Click here to create an account", this will lead you to the registration form. 
Once you are logged, you will be able to select products and proceed to create an order. If you are not convinced, you are able to delete the selected products from the list.
